My name is Yasith, and I'm a grade 11 student, currently studying at a school in the TDSB. I have a small understanding of the mechanics of
coding, and I have some experience coding in Python and C. I understand that I have much to learn, and I would like to further my knowledge of coding, by
taking on projects that could solve practical, real-world problems. In the future, with a bit more experience, I would like to start experimenting with neural
networks, which would evetually lead to my ultimate goal of learning about Machine Learning, and AI. I have seen many videos about AI, such as Google's
AI named "AlphaGo", which has inspired me to work on projects in a similar fasion. I hope that by experimenting through minor projects, I will build the
nessecary skills, needed to undertake these kinds of projects.
